# Welcome to W3C HTML5
HTML5 is the standard language of the Web, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium, also known as W3C. HTML5 is and will continue to be THE essential technology for organizations delivering applications across multiple platforms.

As such, HTML5 is now supported on mobile phones, connected objects, game consoles, automobile dashboards, and devices that havenâ€™t even been considered yet. Write once and deploy anywhere!

In this course, you will learn all the new features that were introduced with HTML5 to help create great Web sites and applications, in a simplified but powerful way.
